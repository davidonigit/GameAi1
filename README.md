A project focused on developing Artificial Intelligence for games. Features include:

- Procedural map generation using a grid layout composed of chunks.
- Each chunk contains randomly spawned enemies, health items, and ammo.]
- The player's position determines which chunks are active, based on its location.
- The player can collect health and ammo items to survive as long as possible.
- Enemies damage the player on contact.
- The player can damage enemies using an ammo powerup that causes area-of-effect damage.
